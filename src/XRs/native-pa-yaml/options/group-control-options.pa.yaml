# Considerations:
# - a group is a sibling to the controls it groups.
# - it's zindex is computed to be: The max zindex of all controls in the group.
#   This means we really don't even need to capture it in document order.

---
# Group control: Option A - Parent-child grouping
# Error: App will be corrupted because zindex will get lost.
# Cannot represent as a container control.
